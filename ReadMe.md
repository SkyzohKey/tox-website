# Tox Website

I decided to make a new website for Tox because the current one is weird and not userfriendly.  
Also, the audience we target is not tech-savvy so the website must be clear and not redundant.

##### Disclaimer
First, the website is **NOT** static.  
It uses AdonisJS for the back-end. Sass is used for the front-end styling.

# Building
This use Gulp as a build tool so you need to run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/SkyzohKey/tox-website.git
cd tox-website
npm install
gulp
```

Now you can access it by clicking on http://127.0.0.1:1340. You can change the port by passing a `PORT`env variable.

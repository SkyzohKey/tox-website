# Tox Website

I decided to make a new website for Tox because the current one is weird and not userfriendly.  
Also, the audience we target is not tech-savvy so the website must be clear and not redundant.

# How to build

First, the website is **NOT** static. It uses AdonisJS for the back-end. Sass is used for the front-end styling.
